WikiFinder is a website that gets your [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com) info to see what game you are playing, then updates a page with info related to that game, like Wikis, videos, and articles. You can then set your homepage for the Steam Web Browser to this page, and every time you open the browser, you'll see links for popular and curated resources related to your game.
